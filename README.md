- 👋 Hi, I’m Denis Kopásek,
- 👀 I am currently a PhD student at the Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, but as my studies are coming to an end, I am looking for a job opportunity.
- 👀 During my studies (already at Bachelor and Master's studies) I have fallen in love with mathematics, whether it is numerical or logical, and I have always considered this discipline as my preference. I developed this hobby in the same way during my PhD studies, when working with data and numbers was the main focus of my tasks, since I was dealing with analysis of data from carried out experiments. The goal was to analyze, clean and compare data from real laboratory experiments with numerical and mathematical models. It was necessary to perform data processing of the experiments performed (tensile tests, accelerated corrosion tests, material tests, etc.), or to construct preliminary numerical models of the behaviour of a real element (most often Excel, MathCAD, SQL databases).
- 🌱 In addition, creating scripts to calculate element behavior was something I was good at and enjoyed. I consider myself more than capable in data processing and working with numbers.
- 💞️ I consider myself more than capable in data processing and working with numbers. My primary objective is to continuously enhance my knowledge and expertise while collaborating with seasoned professionals in the field.
- 📫 If you have any suitable offer, you are more than welcome to reach me via e-mail - kopasek.denis@gmail.com
